<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  I am modelling and analysing the dynamics of neural networks. In particular I am investing how the plasticity of gap junctions (electrical synapses) could regulate the oscillations of electrical activity that are observed in many brain regions. A functional implication of those results is that gap junction plasticity could ensure robust information transfer between brain regions.

  I am also studying the relationship between blood oxygen concentration and neural activity.

  I am also a Graduate Teaching Assistant in Computational Neuroscience, Mathematics and Python Programming courses.

  Dr. Claudia Clopath is my PhD supervisor.

<h2>Qualifications</h2>
<h3>Imperial College London</h3>
<div class="date">Computational Neuroscience Laboratory</div>
<div class="date">London, United Kingdom , November 2014 to October 2017</div>

<p>Ph.D. candidate. I model spiking neural networks and I investigate the functional implications of
activity-dependent plasticity of electrical synapses on network dynamics. In addition, I study how
blood oxygen concentration can predict neural activity. I also collaborate with the Surgical
Planning Laboratory (Harvard Medical School) to improve the segmentation of catheters from
  MRI using machine learning.</p>
