      # Research Laboratory in the Department of Radiology of Brigham and Women's Hospital

      Research Trainee in Radiology, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.
      Finishing my study at TU München, I wrote my master thesis at the Surgical Planning Laboratory.
      This thesis spans mathematical algorithm development in image segmentation and registration
      using mechanically inspired models, design of an evaluation phantom and a dependent study, as
      well as efficient and well-documented software developed in Python and C++, which has been
      released publicly. This work has been followed by several peer-reviewed publications (MICCAI
      2013, Medical Image Analysis 2017).

      # World’s First Minimally Invasive Non-blood Contacting
      #Cardiac Assist Device to Treat Acute Heart Failure.

      Prototyped analog hardware for reading an electrocardiogram (ECG) and driving a pump. This
      was part of the development of a non-blood contacting cardiac assist and support device system
      that pushes the heart wall synchronized with an ECG.

    degree: PhD in Computational Neuroscience
    description: |
      I modeled and analyzed the dynamics of neural networks, focusing on the role of gap junctions, or electrical
      synapses, in regulating the oscillations of electrical activity observed in many brain regions. My research showed
      that gap junction plasticity could play a crucial role in ensuring robust information transfer between brain
      regions. Additionally, I studied the relationship between blood oxygen concentration and neural activity. As a
      Graduate Teaching Assistant, I also assisted in Computational Neuroscience, Mathematics, and Python Programming
      courses.

      I participated in the Top Industrial Managers for Europe program, which
      provides training for future leaders in the industry. During my degree, I completed my thesis at a lab
      affiliated with Harvard Medical School, where I applied research, software engineering, and mechanical engineering
      techniques to the medical field, specifically in radiology. This experience gave me a deep understanding of the
      latest advancements in the field, and the opportunity to collaborate with renowned researchers. It also allowed me
      to hone my research and analytical skills, as well as my ability to work effectively in a team.
